# arcPlayer
processing program that cuts up video and audio and plays it back

the numPlayers variable in the main arcPlayer.pde file defines how many slice there will be
assuming 8 slices. 

the program takes a video and a sound file. it chops the sound into sequential chunks of size total length/number of chucks. the video file is chopped into numPlayers vertical columns that can be turned on and off independently.

when the program is run, you can turn the parts on and off by clicking the grey circles along the bottom of the window. dragging the horizontal slider at the top of the screen sets the global speed of the program from 0.125 (quarter speed) to 2 (double speed). original speed is 1.
